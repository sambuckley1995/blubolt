# Module 2 : JS Basics

## Instructions

You will find a file `index.js` added to this code set.
It has some base data at the top and a comment at the bottom, after this comment please add any functions or instantiations as needed to achieve the requirements. 

## Step 1: 

In the `index.html` you will see a set of buttons, each of them has an instruction of what they should log when clicked. 
Add any selectors you may need to the buttons and then using the `index.js` log the required, achieving the data set logged in the shortest manner possible.
No data should ever be mutated.


# Step 2:
Follow the instructions as defined in the buttons. 

# Step 3: 
Follow the on screen instructions.
