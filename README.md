# Code Understanding & Evaluation

This test set is split into three modules, 

1: Basic Markup & Styling & Flex / Grid Usage (`/moduleOneBasics`)

2: JS array & primative manipulation (`/moduleTwoJSAndPrimatives`)

3: React (`/moduleThreeReact`)

All tests will be reviewed using chrome so no further browser compatibility needs the be addressed. 

## Instructions

All work must be completed on your own without input from others, if there is a question this should be distributed clearly via email to 
richard.ayles@blubolt.com. Use any web based resources you choose, that's what Google is there for, be aware if you are gonna use something off stack or other source and we ask about it you must understand what it is that you did and most importantly the reason for it. 

These Modules are connected in concept, so working Modules 1 then 2 and finally 3 will be more efficient than doing them out of order. 

Node Packages: Node v12.x required

Basic understanding of NPM

1. Make sure you have installed the root node modules `/`
2. Make sure you install the node modules in `/moduleThreeReact`
3. There may be NPM errors debugging these is part of the test.

### Hint

* NVM is a useful tool to work with older version of Node
* Note: from time to time debugging NPM wil be needed, that is part of the test. 

## Working in modules 1 - 2

1. These modules are very similar and each has been bootstrapped with a SCSS compiler, js is expected as browser support no precompile. ES5 / ES6
2. Please read the brief in each of the folders before attempting to undertake them in its entirety. the brief will be outlined in the enclosed `brief.md` file. 
3. Start your dev environment: 
  `npm run dev:1` or `npm run dev:2`

## Working in Module 3 - React
This is bootstrapped from create react app and will simply need you to start it: 
The react code is all encompassed in the enclosed `src` folder you can add components as you see fit, however the `app.js` file will be the core one where work will be required.

1. Read the BRIEF! ( `moduleThreeReact/brief.md`)
2. Start the dev server `npm run dev:react` or via yarn `cd moduleThreeReact/ && yarn start`

## Completing the evaluation

From this supplied zip file create a private repo and do an init commit, add github user `richayles` to the repo for review. 
You can optionally create branches and merge each module back to master, or work on a branch and PR it back requesting a review from Richard. 
All commits should be labelled with the module number - status Complete / Incomplete and time in minutes taken on this commit for this module, please follow the commit message structure in this format `MODULE:$NUMBER - COMPLETE - MM` for example `MODULE:1 - COMPLETE - 93` 

When you are complete drop Richard an email at `richard.ayles@blubolt.com`

## Good Luck

These are all designed to be "relatively" simple, if you are struggling to complete the task in a reasonable amount of time submitting incomplete work is acceptable. Please designate this in the module commit and relay any sticking points back to Richard

### Final Hints
* Feel free to add anything that shows your further knowledge in any of the areas under evaluation, however make sure the brief is met! NEVER OVERENGINEER :)
* Accuracy and reading the brief is more important than the time, please be honest with your time!
