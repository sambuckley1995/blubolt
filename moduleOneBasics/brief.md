# Module 1 : Basics of markup and styling

## Brief Image:
`/moduleOneBasics/Brief-Product.png`


# Step 1:

## Instructions

- Using the index.html & the index.scss you will replicate the product card as provided.
- Minor spacing and exact layout is not required as this will be based off a flat image
- the example image is available at: `http://design.blubolt.com/fe_codetests/group%403x.png` a demo img tag is included.

## Criteria

We are looking for a self contained (main wrapping div) card that outputs the product laid out as in the brief above. 
This should not include absolutely positioned elements and make use of Flex to layout your elements internally. This should be able to be replicable as step two will require this.
The wrapping div will have the class `product-card` 


# Step 2:

## Instructions

We have now created a product card that can be laid out into a CSS Grid based responsive layout. 
Using the `displayed-in-grid.html` add `10` product cards and style this to layout using CSS Grid as the foundation to layout:
Feel free to change out the product text and images if you wish from the references below.
In your dev environment with live loading `/displayed-in-grid.html` will serve this file. 

1. `4` product cards across on desktops larger then `1024px` but constrained to `1440px` wide and centred. The gutters should be `20px`
2. `3` product cards across on tablet `768px - 1024px` 
3. `2` product cards across on mobile less than `768px` 

Note: don't break `index.html`
